# InstaHMS

The InstaHMS project addresses the daily operations of a hospital via effective queries in MySQL. 
This project covers all the steps right from: 
* Schema creation
* Defining constraints
* Data insertion
* Optimized queries to retrieve results quicker
* Inbuilt stored functions and procedures to store the repetitive actions
* Triggers to handle the incoming insertion, updation, and deletion of data
